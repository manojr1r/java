Search Everywhere
Press Ctrl + Shift twice to search for files, actions, symbols, UI elements, Git branches and comments across your project.
Pressing double Shift again, will extend the search to non-project items.
Use tabs or direct shortcuts Ctrl N for classes, Ctrl Shift N for files, Ctrl Alt Shift N for symbols,
and Ctrl Shift A for actions to narrow your search results.

To check all methods in Class
 Ctrl + Click on Windows and Cmd + Click on macOS.
 If we need to see all uses of a class or method in our project, we invoke Edit – Find Usages – Find Usages (Alt + F7).
